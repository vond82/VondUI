# VondUI NieR

Re-creating the NieR-palette versions of my VondUI for FFXIV, as was originally found here back in Endwalker: https://wago.io/vondui_nier, also implementing the changes Moon made while I was gone to keep VondUI working at the start of Dawntrail.
Users of VondUI will feel right at home and the only differences are to the look & feel of the UI.

This is *very much* a WIP and so far only AST and SGE are supported. More jobs will be added shortly, focus is to get all the basic stuff correct first.

#### Pre-reqs
- DelvUI
- DelvCD
- MaterialUI
- LMeter
- Rodin Bold font
- Penumbra* (If going with YoRHa UI as recommended)
#### Recommended
- [YoRHa UI](https://heliosphere.app/mod/q0wkpyem217s7cbj4spa5wm26c) (For NieR icons and theme)
- YoRHa Dark Dalamud Theme (Available from the Dalamud Discord)
  
Threw this up just before I'm going out of town for a couple of days so more previews etc will come later including a proper changelog as there are some minor changes here and there compared to "standard VondUI".
One of the things I want to test is if the font works properly as is or not as I'm not sure about how that works now and don't have time to test before heading out.
