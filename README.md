# VondUI NieR

Very early WIP of the NieR-palette versions of my VondUI for FFXIV, as was originally found here back in Endwalker: https://wago.io/vondui_nier, also implementing the changes Moon made while I was gone to keep VondUI working at the start of Dawntrail.
Users of VondUI will feel right at home and the only differences are to the look & feel of the UI.

This is *very much* a WIP and so far only AST, SGE, DNC, VPR and PLD are supported. More jobs will be added shortly, focus is to get all the basic stuff correct first.

### FAQ
<details><summary>1. What is this circle around my mouse?!</summary>

* This is the GCD indicator / mouse tracker. You can configure or disable it under Misc > GCD Indicator in the DelvUI Config.

</details>

<details><summary>2. How do I import a profile?</summary>

> 1. Click the "Copy DelvUI Import String" link above.
> 2. Open up the DelvUI Config and go to the Profiles tab
> 3. Type the name you'd like for the profile, for example "VondUI DPS"
> 4. Click "Import from clipboard"
> 5. Done
</details>

<details><summary>3. Can I import only specific parts of a profile?</summary>

* Short answer, yes. Longer answer, yes like so:

> 1. Copy the DelvUI Profile string as usual.
> 2. Go to the Imports tab in DelvUI.
> 3. Paste the string and click Import.
> 4. Options will pop up to select what you would like to import, select/deselect as appropriate.
</details>

<details><summary>4. How can I copy your HUD Layout for the vanilla game elements?</summary>

> Eventually I'll get around to setting up a HUD Manager import string since that addon has returned. For now, you can have a look at this screenshot from my HUD Layout window.

</details>

<details><summary>5. How do I import the provided DelvCD profiles?</summary>

> 1. Copy the string you want to import from the DelvCD Profiles folder. 
> 2. Make sure DelvCD is installed and type /dcd ingame.
> 3. Click the "Import" button.
> 4. Done!

</details>

<details><summary>6. Do I need to use your DelvUI Profile to use your DelvCD profiles?</summary>

* No. But for many jobs the DelvUI Job Specific Bars are setup to work alongside the DCDs, such as the Step tracker for DNC etc, so choosing to only import the DCDs will mean you'll need to set up some stuff yourself.

</details>

<details><summary>6. When will the other jobs be available?</summary>

* When they're done.
