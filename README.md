# VondUI NieR

Re-creating the NieR-palette versions of my VondUI for FFXIV, as was originally found here back in Endwalker: https://wago.io/vondui_nier
Users of VondUI will feel right at home and the only differences are to the look & feel of the UI.

This is *very much* a WIP and so far only AST and SGE are supported. More jobs will be added shortly, focus is to get all the basic stuff correct first.

#### Pre-reqs
- DelvUI
- DelvCD
- MaterialUI
- LMeter
- Penumbra (*If going with YoRHa UI as recommended)
#### Recommended
- [YoRHa UI](https://heliosphere.app/mod/q0wkpyem217s7cbj4spa5wm26c) (For NieR icons and theme)
- YoRHa Dark Dalamud Theme (Available from the Dalamud Discord)
  
Threw this up just before I'm going out of town for a couple of days so more previews etc will come later.
